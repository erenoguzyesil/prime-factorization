# Prime Factorization of a Number in Exponential Form

This project demonstrates the implementation of prime factorization (in exponential form), prime divisors & divisors of a number.

Methods:  
`PrimeFactorization.primeFactorization(int n)`: Returns the prime factorization of `n` in exponential form as `String`.
`PrimeFactorization.primeDivisors(int n)`: Returns the prime divisors of `n` as `int[]`.  
`PrimeFactorization.divisors(int n)`: Returns the divisors of `n` as `int[]`.
